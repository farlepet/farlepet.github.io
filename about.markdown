I'm Peter Farley, an Embedded Engineer in Minnesota. I graduated from the University
of St. Thomas with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. In my professional life, I
write software for embedded devices, in particular power concious microcontroller-based
products utilizing cellular for networking, and GNSS receivers for location.

In my personal life I also enjoy working with embedded systems, though more from
the perspective of reverse-engineering existing products, whether it be just for
fun or to modify/extend their capabilities. I also have an interest in RF technology,
particularly at microwave frequencies. While I do have an amateur radio license
(KE0WCZ), I don't really use it all that much.

Most of my software/hardware projects can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/farlepet)
